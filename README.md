- Google Photos Library API enabled on your Google Cloud project.
- `requests`, `google-auth`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, and `google-api-python-client` Python packages.

## Google Photos API Setup

To use this script, you need to enable the Google Photos Library API and set up OAuth credentials. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**  
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and name it (e.g., `Google Photos Downloader`).

2. **Enable the Google Photos Library API**  
   - In the API Library, search for "Google Photos Library API" and enable it.

3. **Set Up OAuth Consent Screen**  
   - Configure the OAuth consent screen with your app name and email.

4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**  
   - Create credentials for a "Desktop app" and download the `credentials.json` file.

5. **Move `credentials.json` to Project Directory**  
   - Place the file in the root of your project directory.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/josephnittala/google-photos-downloader.git
   cd google-photos-downloader
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Script

python download_google_photos.py
```

The first time you run the script, you'll be prompted to authenticate your Google account.

## Logging and Error Checking
